This document summarizes the development process and marks all planned tasks as complete. The project is now feature-complete and ready for deployment.

---

### Development Checklist

#### Phase 1: Initial Backend & Frontend Setup
- [x] **Environment Setup**: Python virtual environment created.
- [x] **Backend Dependencies**: Installed FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, Cryptography.
- [x] **Frontend Scaffolding**: Initialized a Vanilla JavaScript project.

#### Phase 2: Core Backend Logic
- [x] **Database Configuration**: Configured SQLAlchemy with a `Paste` model.
- [x] **Pydantic Schemas**: Defined schemas for API request and response validation.
- [x] **Encryption & ID Generation**: Implemented `Fernet` encryption and a unique ID generator.
- [x] **"Create" API (`/api/create`)**: Built the endpoint to receive, encrypt, and store new pastes.
- [x] **"Read & Destroy" API (`/api/get/{id}`)**: Built the endpoint to retrieve pastes, enforcing expiration by time or view count.

#### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation & UI/UX Overhaul
- [x] **Initial UI**: Created a basic interface for creating and viewing pastes.
- [x] **Single-Page Application (SPA) Refactor**: Converted the multi-page frontend into a modern SPA for a smoother user experience.
- [x] **UI Redesign**: Overhauled the entire user interface with a clean, professional, and modern design.
- [x] **Internationalization (i18n)**: Implemented English/Chinese language switching.
- [x] **Theme Switching**: Implemented Light/Dark/System theme modes.
- [x] **Modular JavaScript**: Refactored frontend JavaScript into maintainable modules (`i18n.js`, `theme.js`, `script.js`).

#### Phase 4: Deployment Preparation
- [x] **Database Flexibility**: Updated database configuration to support PostgreSQL via environment variables for production, while retaining SQLite for local development.
- [x] **Dependency Management**: Added `psycopg2-binary` and `python-dotenv` to `requirements.txt` for robust deployment.
- [x] **Deployment Configuration**: Created a `render.yaml` file to define all services (Database, Backend, Frontend) for one-click deployment on Render.
- [x] **API & Static File Serving**: Correctly configured the FastAPI backend to serve the frontend as a static SPA and handle API routing.

### Next Steps (Manual)

All automated development tasks are complete. The following steps are to be performed by the user:

- **1. Git Initialization**: 
    - Initialize a Git repository (`git init`).
    - Create a `.gitignore` file.
    - Commit all project files.
- **2. Push to Repository**: 
    - Create a new repository on GitHub/GitLab.
    - Push the local project to the remote repository.
- **3. Deploy on Render**: 
    - Connect the Git repository to a new "Blueprint" service on Render.
    - Let Render automatically build and deploy the application using `render.yaml`.
    - Set the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable in the Render service settings.
